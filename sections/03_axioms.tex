\section{Axioms of U₁ Monetary Systems}

\begin{axiom}[A₁ Energy–Bounded Leader Election]
Block production requires verifiable expenditure of physical energy such that issuance cost $E_{issue} \ge E_{verify}$. No valid unit may exist without irreversible work.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[A₂ Public Verifiability]
Any observer with public data and bounded computation can audit total supply, validate transaction history, and verify current state without trusted intermediaries.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[A₃ Probabilistic Finality]
The ledger exhibits irreversible settlement with known probabilistic bounds; reorganization probability decays exponentially with confirmation depth under the honest-majority assumption.
\end{axiom}

\begin{axiom}[A₄ Monetary Closure]
Aggregate monetary supply is finite and mathematically enforced:
$\sum U_t \le S_{max}$ across all valid histories. Inflationary creation is invalid under consensus rules.
\end{axiom}
