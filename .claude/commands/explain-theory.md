# Explain U1 Conjecture Theory

Explain the U1 Conjecture theory at the requested level.

## Instructions

Ask me what aspect to explain and at what level (intuitive, technical, or mathematical).

### Core Concepts to Cover

**Intuitive Level:**
- Money as a database of future claims
- κ measures assumption burden
- Capital flows to systems requiring fewer assumptions

**Technical Level:**
- Axioms A₁–A₄ and their implications
- S as Landauer-normalized cumulative energy
- H as Shannon entropy over future monetary states
- Capital flow gradient conjecture

**Mathematical Level:**
- Formal definitions from proofs/coordination-capacity/v0.3/C_coord_v0.3.tex
- Boundary behavior propositions
- Security exponent β and irreversibility density ρ_irr
- Connection to Shannon capacity

### Key Results to Reference

1. κ_BTC ≈ 10³⁹ (S → ∞, H → 0)
2. κ_BTC / κ_Gold ≈ 10²¹ (phase transition)
3. Capital flows from low-κ to high-κ systems
4. PoS has κ ≈ 0 (no thermodynamic anchor)
