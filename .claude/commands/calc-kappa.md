# Calculate κ for a Monetary System

Help me calculate the coordination capacity ratio (κ = S/H) for a monetary system.

## Instructions

Ask me which system to analyze, then:

1. **Estimate S (Thermodynamic Irreversibility)**:
   - Identify the physical process anchoring the ledger
   - Estimate cumulative energy expenditure (joules)
   - Apply Landauer normalization: S = E_cum / (k_B T ln 2) where k_B T ln 2 ≈ 2.87 × 10⁻²¹ J

2. **Estimate H (Monetary Entropy)**:
   - Assess supply determinism (is there a fixed cap?)
   - Evaluate governance/policy discretion
   - Consider protocol ossification status
   - Estimate in bits of uncertainty

3. **Calculate κ = S/H**

4. **Compare to references**:
   - Bitcoin: κ ≈ 10³⁹
   - Gold: κ ≈ 10¹⁸
   - USD: κ ≈ 10⁶

5. **Assess**: Is this incremental improvement or phase transition relative to existing systems?

Be explicit about all assumptions and provide confidence intervals where appropriate.
